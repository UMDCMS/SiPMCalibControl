# Operation Manual

This is the page for using the operation the system for running calibration
routines.

## Starting up the program

The default operation mode should be for operators to use the GUI to run
calibration processes. Running individual calibration processes should only be
handled by the system experts.

Before starting the GUI program, make sure that you know which tileboard
readout system you will be using, and make sure all the software on the readout
system is set up:

- For the common tileboard tester readout system: TO-BE-CONFIRMED
- For using the gantry system for extended testing, see the setup for the
  [GantryMQ][gmq] system.

After this, you can start the program using following command: 

```
python bin/start_gui_server.py
```

Once this has started you can open a browser on your machine and navigate to
`localhost:9100`. You should be greeted with the display page:
