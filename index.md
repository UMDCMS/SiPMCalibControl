# SiPM Calibration system operation manual

This GitHub pages sites aims to be the operation command tutorial. For technical
developments of the code, given the limited resources available for hosting
web-page based information on the GitHub, it was determined that the code
developers should be more technically inclined to read the documentation directly
using the directory README files and the documentation strings included in the
code. Until an easier solution is found, this page would be reserved for
operation level documentation.

Right now there are two large segments of the tutorial:

- [The CLI interface](cli): For the most direct control of all subsystems of
  provided in the gantry system.
- [The Web-base interface](gui): For a high-level control of calibration
  routines.

- Documentation of the control software: See the
  [SiPMCalibControl][SiPMCalibControl] repository and the in-code documentations,
  and the the CMS detector note [DN-19-048][DN-19-048] for an offical paper and
  references.
- Documentation of the analysis software: See the [SiPMCalib][SiPMCalib]
  repository and the in-code documentation, or the CMS detector note
  [DN-19-048][DN-19-048] for references.
