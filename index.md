# SiPM Calibration system operation wiki page

This wiki page aims to be the operation command tutorial. For techincal developments of the code, given the limited resources availabled for hosting web-page based information on the GitHub, it was determined that the code developers should be more techincally inclined to read the documentation directly using the directory README files and the documentation strings included in the code. Until an easier solution is found, this page would be reserved for operation level documentation.
