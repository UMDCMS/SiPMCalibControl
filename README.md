# SiPM Calibration control software

Software used for the data collection of the SiPM calibration gantry system
developed by UMD. Documentations found in the repository files will mainly
be used to describe coding and programming technical details regarding the
control software. See the following links for other documentations related to
the SiPM calibration project.

- [Operation manual][manual]: Primary manual that should be used by the
  operators. Require minimum knowledge of the package in general.
- [Deploy instruction][deploy]: The manual for setting up the control interface
  on a brand-new machine for the deployment of a new system, or for testing on
  the developer side.
- [Development instructions][dev_manual]: General information about how to
  navigate the various source code directories, as well as links to resources
  on learning the technologies in this package.

Notice that this package will not contain the analysis code required for
detailed results analysis. That is hosted on a separate repository
[here][sipmanalyze].
