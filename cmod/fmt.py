@defgroup Logging Logging

@details Instead of C/C++'s `printf/std::cout` method and the python `print`
method, all program outputs should used the python [`logging`][python-logging]
module to allow for a unified method for processing output streams, as well as
single call allow for post-processing into persistent log files either for
debugging or for documentation construction, or even later for the construction
of GUI display elements.

On the C++ side, all `printf` or `std::cout` statements should be replaced by
the various `printx` method provided in the logger.hpp file, with the
appropriate logging levels. We will use the facilities provided in the
`pybind11` to expose the python logging module to the C++ functions.

On the python side, various functions and classes will be provided for the
processing and formatting of the logging strings, as well as some niceties for
common string formatting routines.


[python-logging]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html


Python helper function for helping with logging string formatting. This includes
ASCII color code injection. And well as additional formatting to be performed
for logging. As all outputs should be logged through python logging, we
introduce more logging levels to better track all information.
